Including figures with ESOFORM proposals
=========================================

As of Period 74, ESOFORM LaTeX proposals are converted to
printable format using "pdfLaTeX" instead of "LaTeX". The change
should be largely transparent for all submissions that do not include
figures (macro \MakePicture); this guide addresses issues related to
composing an ESOFORM proposal with figures. The following notes are
very much oriented towards users of Unix derivatives like Linux,
Solaris or MacOS X.

IMPORTANT NOTE: pdfLaTeX allows one to include a figure file without
                any filename extensions (like ".pdf" or ".jpg").
                Filenames used within \MakePicture macros, on the
                other hand, should ALWAYS specify the
                extension; failing to do so may result in your
                proposal failing validation.

DISCLAIMER:     The European Southern Observatory does not endorse,
                support, or distribute any of the software tools
                mentioned in this document.


1. Basics
---------

pdfLaTeX supports inclusion of different picture formats. ESOFORM
figures -- previously included as Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files --
can now be included as PDF, JPEG or PNG files; multiple formats can be
included in the same proposal. Which format to choose depends on
available software tools, the type of figure, the desired quality and
the file size.

PNG and JPEG are "raster" formats; that is, they represent an
image as a grid of pixels. They are the natural representation for
image-type data, but do not lend themselves as well to represent
"vector" type graphics, or text.

PDF files are written in a more high-level language resembling
PostScript: text objects and arcs are stored as such, not as bitmaps,
and can be better scaled and rotated. Although not as large as
PostScript files, PDF files are generally larger than an equivalent
raster image. 

ESO supports PDF 1.0 to 1.3; regardless of format, figure files should not be larger that 1 MB.


2. What should I do?
--------------------

Experiment: if the software tool you are using can generate your
figure in different formats, try them out and compare their output
(don't forget that proposals at ESO are printed and distributed to the
Panels in black & white!). Choose a format that makes your proposal
visually appealing while generating a small figure file: larger files
take more time to upload, increasing the probability of transmission
failures.


3. My software tool can only generate PostScript: now what?
-----------------------------------------------------------

EPS files cannot be directly processed by pdfLaTeX. However,
conversion of a figure file from PostScript to PDF is generally easy
and generates smaller, high quality images. EPS files can be converted
to PDF by GhostScript, Acrobat Distiller or other PDF-to-PS
converters (see section "Web resources" below). 
To get around bounding box issues, however, we recommend
to use "epstopdf", a publicly available Perl script that transforms
the EPS file so that the start point is at the (0,0) coordinate, and
the page size is set to exactly correspond to the bounding box.

IMPORTANT NOTE: epstopdf makes use of GhostScript, and is available on
                Solaris, Linux, MacOS X, and other Unix derivatives.
                Please make sure you are using version 8.0 or later of
                GhostScript. Although old versions might work there is
                a higher chance of conversion problems.

You may alternatively want to run "convert" (part of the ImageMagick
suite of tools) on your EPS file:
          convert figure.eps figure.pdf


4. I can't get my PDF right, help!
-----------------------------------

If you really cannot convert your EPS figure to PDF, you can try
converting it to one of the supported raster files, but the quality
will probably suffer. Here are some possible procedures.

(4.1) Open your EPS file with "xv", then save it as JPG or PNG.

(4.2) If they are available on your system, use GhostScript and the 
      Netpbm utilities to convert your EPS file to PNG via PNM
      ("portable anymap" file). You can use "pstoimg" to help you: try
      "pstoimg -help" for a list of available options.

(4.3) Open your EPS file with a PostScript viewer like "gv", then grab
      the image with some screen dump utility, like "xv" (on Windows,
      you can use "GSview" and "!Quick Screen Capture", respectively).
      The grabbed image can be saved in raster format.


5. I'm lost!
------------

If all else fails, you can try to contact ESOFORM support at
esoform@eso.org; we will do our best to try and help you get your
figures right. Beware that your chances to get effective help will
decrease to just about zero as we get close to the submission line:
the last days and hours are usually hectic. Help us to help you: get
to work on your figures well in advance of the deadline.
